        "&lt;p>&lt;big>&lt;b>What is the Cooper (12 minute run) Test?&lt;/b>&lt;/big>&lt;/p>"
        "&lt;p>It is one of the most popular stamina tests for athletes and common people alike, "
        "and a great way to evaluate your fitness and compare it with your friends.&lt;/p>"
        "&lt;p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:&lt;br/>"
        "\"The Cooper test is a test of physical fitness. It was designed by Kenneth H. Cooper in 1968 for US military use."
        "The point of the test is to run as far as possible within 12 minutes."
        "The test is meant to measure the condition of the person taking it and therefore it is supposed"
        "to be run at a steady pace instead of sprints and fast running."
        "The outcome is based on the distance the test person ran, their age and their sex.\"&lt;br/>"
        "You can find the table with result interpretation below&lt;/p>"

        "&lt;p>The aim of our application is to provide an easy, automatic way to perform the test for every "
        "owner of a device with geolocation. "
        "No need for someone else to measure your distance and time - it's all there in your app!&lt;/p>"

        "&lt;p>&lt;big>&lt;b>Before performing the test:&lt;/b>&lt;/big>"
        "&lt;ul>&lt;li>\tFill your data in settings, so that we can interpret your results.&lt;/li>"
        "&lt;li>\tActivate GPS on your device (+ mobile data if you can, for better accuracy and route display)&lt;/li>"
        "&lt;li>\tFind a clear, flat, not slippery path for running. The app should be used outdoors for maximum GPS accuracy.&lt;/li>"
        "&lt;li>\tMake sure you warm up for at least 15 minutes, in order to avoid injuries and get the best possible result&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>"
        "You can run in circles, or come back the same way. For reasonable accuracy the length of the "
        "circle / one way path should be at least ~100m (yards)&lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/p>"

        "&lt;p>The test will start with a 10 second countdown with beep sounds, then an actual 12 minute test begins. "
        "You will be notified (text-to-speech audio) when you have 10m, 8m, 6m, 4m, 2m, 1m, 30s, 15s left. The last 10 seconds are "
        "indicated with the same beeping sounds as the pre-test countdown.&lt;/p>"

        "&lt;p>Good luck!!!&lt;/p>"
        "&lt;p>Here is the table (from Wikipedia) for interpreting your results (brief description will be visible after you complete the test as well)&lt;/p>"
