# Cooper Test GPS Android App

## What is the Cooper (12 minute run) Test?

It is one of the most popular stamina tests for athletes and common people alike, and a great way to evaluate your fitness and compare it with your friends.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

The Cooper test is a test of physical fitness. It was designed by Kenneth H. Cooper in 1968 for US military use.
The point of the test is to run as far as possible within 12 minutes.
The test is meant to measure the condition of the person taking it and therefore it is supposed
to be run at a steady pace instead of sprints and fast running.
The outcome is based on the distance the test person ran, their age and their sex.

## What is the goal of our app?

The aim of our application is to provide an easy, automatic way to perform the test for every owner of a device with geolocation. No need for someone else to measure your distance and time - it's all there in your app! 

## Features
* Automatic stamina evaluation - just start the test, run and listen to the sound notifications, and the result will be ready for you
* You can safely put the device in your pocket - location will still be updated, and our app will keep showing on your lock screen if you'd like to take a quick look
* See your route on the map as you run
* Monitor your speed and see if you're on track to reach your target result, or beat your previous best
* All the results are saved - track your fitness and routes you covered
* Choose between dark and light theme for the app - also for maps!

## How to use

**Before the test**

* Fill your data in settings, so that we can interpret your results"
* Activate GPS on your device (+ mobile data if you can, for better accuracy and route display)
* Find a clear, flat, not slippery path for running. The app should be used outdoors for maximum GPS accuracy
* Make sure you warm up for at least 15 minutes, in order to avoid injuries and get the best possible result

You can run in circles, or come back the same way. For reasonable accuracy the length of the circle / one way path should be at least ~100m (yards). 

The test will start with a 10 second countdown with beep sounds, then an actual 12 minute test begins. You will be notified (text-to-speech audio) when you have 10m, 8m, 6m, 4m, 2m, 1m, 30s, 15s left. The last 10 seconds are indicated with the same beeping sounds as the pre-test countdown

Note: Don't worry if you're testing our app at home and the location oscillates, making the map show weird routes. GPS noise is more significant indoors, but when you actually go outdoors to perform the test, the accuracy should be very good (depending on the GPS signal quality of course)

## Permissions

We need your location to calculate the distance and show your route on the map. On some devices you might also need to give the permission for working as a foreground service, so that location is still updated when you lock the screen or minimize the app
